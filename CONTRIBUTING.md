## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the docstrings and documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
